# Front-End-Coding-Challenge
Website recreation exercise

This was a timed exercise where I built a website from a PS file. The website had the following rules:
- Page should be fully responsive
- Upon zip code entry, automatically populate City/State fields using http://ziptasticapi.com
- Page should make use of javascript to move the user through 3 pages of the form in an on-page app.
- Logo should use the included SVG with a PNG as fallback
